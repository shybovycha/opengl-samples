# ShootThem!

## Quick overview

This is a very simple shooting game I made many years ago. It is written in C++ with Irrlicht game engine and IrrKlang library for sounds. All level models are hand-made, other assets are taken from third-party games or libraries.

## Build

1. Unpack `irrKlang` and `irrlicht` libraries within the `Dependencies` directory
2. Create the `build` directory, open it with the terminal and run `cmake .. && make`
